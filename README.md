# Bank_Loan_Report
The "Bank Loan Report" project aims to analyze and summarize the loan data of a bank to provide valuable insights into loan performance, customer demographics, and risk assessment. This analysis will help the bank in decision-making processes, such as identifying potential defaulters, understanding customer profiles, and optimizing loan offerings.
